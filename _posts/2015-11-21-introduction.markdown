<h2 class="article-heading">What is Machine Learning?</h2>
<p>Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence(AI) that
provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly
programmed.</p>


<h2 class="article-heading">Types of Machine Learning:</h2>

<h3>Supervised Learning</h3>
<p>In this method of learning we give the algorithm a list of inputs
along with their outputs and the algorithm builds a model which helps it
to predict the outputs for new inputs</p>

<h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3>
<p>In this method of learning we give the algorithm a list of inputs and
it is left to the algorithm to classify the data</p>
